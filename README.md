# Atlas_Project


The answer is love.

This is an attempt to make a story that will bring people together more efficiently than the bible, the quran, the bagavadghita, the torah, etc.

I will start by basing the story on the tale of Jesus and uncle Tom. I am very open to changing course completely, if a better option is available. I have decided to use github as the platform for editing this document, because I intend this story, or set of stories, to undergo many revisions. I also indend for anyone willing to to add to the story in much the same way that Linux is managed and developed.

The aim is to bring more love to the world, and I think that the plan above is the temporarily the best method to do so.

Structure: Come with suggestions to improve, if you think there is a better way :) Stories are a distilation of the human experience, so the plan is to distill many stories into great stories.. New stories of maximum 3 lines are written as a txt file to the new stories folder with associated tags. According to the tags, new stories are paired, where the two authors must combine the two stories into one story, keeping as much of the philosophy as possible, and discarding the rest. The new file is added to the 'first-stage' folder and has a max size of 5 lines.

This first stage is peer reviewed by someone
